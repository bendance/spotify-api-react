So, what would I want to do for this project...?

I want to create an app that allows a user to input their spotify username and creates a new playlist for them based on their tastes

This is a good baseline for my project

So what will we do today?

- start node app to setup reactJS
- learn how to post spotify user to get their user tastes

So, we use Node as our backend and ReactJS as our FE
APIs are generally run on the backend

When a username is submitted, I want to see it console logged on the backend

Authenticate -> Login -> Get Auth Code ->

we now can get teh access code in our FE :)

so now it is time to use this access code to execute some tasks with out api

We can!

Let's clean up our code and then think about what we want to do next

So here's what the form will be, a button to authenticate the user, then after the user is authenticated, they are taken to a form
where they can enter playlist credentials along with their favorite genre of music, a playlist will then be created that displays the 
top 50 songs of that genre. Good!

So, let's go ahead and create a basic form

We'll start with putting the authentication button on a seperate page
