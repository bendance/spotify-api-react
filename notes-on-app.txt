So, what would I want to do for this project...?

I want to create an app that allows a user to input their spotify username and creates a new playlist for them based on their tastes

This is a good baseline for my project

So what will we do today?

- start node app to setup reactJS
- learn how to post spotify user to get their user tastes

So, we use Node as our backend and ReactJS as our FE
