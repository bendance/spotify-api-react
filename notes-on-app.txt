So, what would I want to do for this project...?

I want to create an app that allows a user to input their spotify username and creates a new playlist for them based on their tastes

This is a good baseline for my project

So what will we do today?

- start node app to setup reactJS
- learn how to post spotify user to get their user tastes

So, we use Node as our backend and ReactJS as our FE
APIs are generally run on the backend

When a username is submitted, I want to see it console logged on the backend

Authenticate -> Login -> Get Auth Code ->

we now can get teh access code in our FE :)

so now it is time to use this access code to execute some tasks with out api

We can!

Let's clean up our code and then think about what we want to do next
